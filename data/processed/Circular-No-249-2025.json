    "Circular No. 249/06/2025-GST F. No. GST/INV/DIN-Utility/2022-23 Government of India Ministry of Finance Department of Revenue (Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs) New Delhi, Dated - 09-06-2025. Subject: Generation and quoting of Document Identi\ufb01cation Number (DIN) on any communication issued by the o\ufb03cers of the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) to tax payers and other concerned persons- reg. Attention is invited to Board's Circular No. 122/41/2019- GST dated 05th November 2019 and 128/47/2019-GST dated 23.12.2019, which were issued for implementation of decision regarding Generation and Quoting of Document Identi\ufb01cation Number (DIN), initially on speci\ufb01ed documents and subsequently expanded to all communications (including e-mails) sent to taxpayers and other concerned persons by any o\ufb03ce of CBIC. This was done with a view to leverage technology for greater accountability and transparency in communications with the trade/ taxpayers/ other concerned persons. 2. It has been brought to the notice of the Board that the documents and summary generated through the common portal of GST always bear a Reference No. (RFN), which is veri\ufb01able through the portal ( a t https://services.gst.gov.in/services/verifyRfn). On veri\ufb01cation, the portal provides details of the document such as Date of RFN generation, Date of issuing the Document, Module, Type of Communication and Name of the O\ufb03ce issuing the Document. 3. Reference, in this regard, is also invited to Section 169(1)(d) of the CGST Act, 2017, which provides that any decision, order, summons, notice or other communication shall be served by making it available on the common portal. Further vide Instruction No. 4/2023-GST dated 23.11.2023, CBIC emphasised on strict compliance of rule 142 of CGST Rules and directed to ensure that summary of Show Cause Notices in Form GST DRC-01 and summary of the Order-in-Original in Form GST DRC-07 should be served electronically on common portal / uploaded electronically on the common portal. 4. In light of the above, quoting DIN on such communications generated through the common portal of GST, which already bear RFN, results into two di\ufb00erent electronically generated verifiable unique numbers namely RFN & DIN on the same communication, which renders quoting of DIN on such communication unnecessary. GST/INV/DIN-Utility/2022-23 I/116322/2025 5. It is therefore clari\ufb01ed that for communications via common portal (in compliance with Section 169 of the CGST Act, 2017) having veri\ufb01able Reference Number (RFN), quoting of Document Identi\ufb01cation Number (DIN) is not required and such communication bearing RFN is to be treated as a valid communication. 6. To the above extent, Circular No. 122/41/2019- GST dated 05th November 2019 and 128/47/2019-GST dated 23.12.2019 issued by the Board, stands modified.
