    "Circular No. 224/18/2024 - GST CBIC-20001/4/2024-GST Government of India Ministry of Finance Department of Revenue Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs GST Policy Wing **** New Delhi, Dated the 11th July, 2024 To, The Pr. Chief Commissioners / Chief Commissioners / Principal Commissioners / Commissioners of Central Tax (All) The Principal Directors General / Directors General (All) Madam/Sir, Subject: Guidelines for recovery of outstanding dues, in cases wherein first appeal has been disposed of, till Appellate Tribunal comes into operation. Doubts have been raised by the trade and the field formations in respect of recovery of outstanding dues, in cases where the first appellate authority has confirmed the demand created by the adjudicating authority, fully or partially, and where appeal against such order of appellate authority could not be filed under section 112 of the Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 (hereinafter referred to as \u2018the CGST Act\u2019) due to non- constitution of Appellate Tribunal (hereinafter referred to as \u2018Tribunal\u2019), as yet. Doubts have also been raised as to whether the amount that was originally intended to be paid towards the demand created but has inadvertently been paid and intimated by the taxpayer through FORM GST DRC-03 either under the \u2018voluntary\u2019 category or under the \u2018others\u2019 category, can be adjusted against the pre-deposit that is required to be paid by the taxpayer for filing appeal before the appellate authority under section 107, and before the appellate tribunal under section 112 of the CGST Act. 2. The matter has been examined. In order to clarify the issue and to ensure uniformity in the implementation of the provisions of the law across field formations, the Board, in exercise of its powers conferred by section 168 (1) of the CGST Act, hereby issues the following clarifications and guidelines. 3. In cases, where the first appellate authority has confirmed the demand issued by the adjudicating authority, partially or fully, the taxpayers cannot file appeal against the said appellate order at present due to non-operation of GST Appellate Tribunal as yet. As per Section 112 of the CGST Act, every person has statutory remedy of appeal against the order passed by the first appellate authority or by a revisional authority, before the Tribunal. As per section 78 of CGST Act, the recovery proceedings are to be initiated, if the amount payable as per the order issued under the said act is not paid by the concerned person within the said period of three months from the date of service of the said order. It may further be noted that if any person files an appeal in accordance with the requirement of sub-section (8) of section 112 of the CGST Act (i.e., on payment of prescribed pre-deposit), the recovery proceedings for the balance amount is deemed to be stayed till disposal of the appeal as per sub-section (9) of section 112 of the CGST Act. However, as the taxpayers are not able to file appeal under section 112 in Appellate Tribunal against the orders",
    "of appellate authority and therefore, are not able to make the pre-deposit under sub-section (8) of section 112 of CGST Act, in some cases, the tax officers are taking a view that there is no stay against recovery as per sub-section (9) of section 112 of CGST Act. In some cases, taxpayers have either paid or are willing to pay the requisite amount of pre-deposit as per sub-section (8) of section 112 of CGST Act either by crediting in their electronic liability register against the demand so created, or by depositing the said amount through FORM DRC-03. However, tax officers are still resorting to recovery proceedings after completion of period stipulated under section 78 of CGST Act. 4. In order to facilitate the taxpayers to make the payment of the amount of pre-deposit as per sub-section (8) of section 112 of CGST Act, and to avail the benefit of stay from recovery of the remaining amount of confirmed demand as per sub-section (9) of section 112 of CGST Act, it is hereby clarified that in cases where the taxpayer decides to file an appeal against the order of the appellate authority and wants to make the payment of the amount of pre-deposit as per sub-section (8) of section 112 of CGST Act, he can make the payment of an amount equal to the amount of pre-deposit by navigating to Services >> Ledgers>> Payment towards demand, from his dashboard. The taxpayer would be navigated to Electronic Liability Register (ELL) Part-II in which he can select the order, out of the outstanding demand orders, against which payment is intended to be made. The amount so paid would be mapped against the selected order and demand amount would be reduced in the balance liability in the aforesaid register. The said amount deposited by the taxpayer will be adjusted against the amount of pre-deposit required to be deposited at the time of filing appeal before the Appellate Tribunal. 5. The taxpayer also needs to file an undertaking/ declaration with the jurisdictional proper officer that he will file appeal against the said order of the appellate authority before the Appellate Tribunal, as and when it comes into operation, within the timelines mentioned in section 112 of the CGST Act read with Central Goods and Services Tax (Ninth Removal of Difficulties) Order, 2019 dated 03.12.2019. On providing the said undertaking and on payment of an amount equal to the amount of pre-deposit as per the procedure mentioned in para 4 above, the recovery of the remaining amount of confirmed demand as per the order of the appellate authority will stand stayed as per provisions of sub-section (9) of section 112 of CGST Act. 6. In case, the taxpayer does not make the payment of the amount equal to amount of pre-deposit or does not provide the undertaking/ declaration to the proper officer, then it will be presumed that taxpayer is not willing to file appeal against the order of the appellate authority and in such cases,",
    "recovery proceedings can be initiated as per the provisions of law. Similarly, when the Tribunal comes into operation, if the taxpayer does not file appeal within the timelines specified in Section 112 of the CGST Act read with Central Goods and Services Tax (Ninth Removal of Difficulties) Order, 2019 dated 03.12.2019, the remaining amount of the demand will be recovered as per the provisions of law. 7.1 It has also been noticed that some taxpayers have already paid amounts that were intended to have been paid towards a demand, through FORM GST DRC-03. Attention is invited to notification No. 12/2024- CT dated 10.07.2024, vide which sub-rule (2B) of Rule 142 and FORM GST DRC-03A has been inserted in Central Goods and Services Rules, 2017 (hereinafter referred to as \u2018CGST Rules), providing for a mechanism for cases where the person liable to pay tax, interest and penalty under section 52 or section 73 or section 74 or section 76 or section 122 or section 123 or section 124 or section 125 or section 127 or section 129 or section 130 of CGST Act has made payment of such tax, interest and penalty, inadvertently through FORM GST DRC-03 under sub-rule (2) of Rule 142. In such cases, the said person can file an application in FORM GST DRC-03A, electronically on the common portal, and the amount so paid and intimated through the FORM GST DRC-03 shall be adjusted as if the said payment was made towards the said demand on the date of such intimation through FORM GST DRC-03. 7.2 Accordingly, in cases where the concerned taxpayer has paid an amount that was intended to have been paid towards a particular demand through FORM GST DRC-03, has submitted an application in FORM GST DRC-03A on the common portal, the amount so paid and intimated through the FORM GST DRC-03 will be considered as if the payment was made towards the said demand on the date of such intimation through FORM GST DRC-03. The amount so paid shall also be liable to be adjusted towards the amount required to be paid as pre-deposit under Section 107 and Section 112 of the CGST Act, if and when the taxpayer files an appeal against the said demand, before the appellate authority or the appellate tribunal, as mentioned in para 4 above, and the remaining amount of confirmed demand as per the order of the adjudicating authority or the appellate authority, as the case may be, will stand stayed as per provisions of sub-section (6) of section 107 and sub-section (9) of section 112 of CGST Act. However, if the taxpayer does not file appeal within the timelines prescribed in Section 107 and Section 112 of the CGST Act, as the case may be, read with Central Goods and Services Tax (Ninth Removal of Difficulties) Order, 2019 dated 03.12.2019, the remaining amount of the demand will be recovered as per the provisions of law. 7.3 In this regard, it is to be mentioned that the application",
    "in FORM GST DRC-03A for adjustment of demand liability against the payment through FORM GST DRC-03 cannot be made in cases where against the payment made through the said FORM GST DRC-03, proceedings have already been concluded by issuance of an order in FORM GST DRC-05 as per the Rule 142(3) of CGST Rules, 2017. 8.1 Currently, the above-mentioned functionality for filing of an application in FORM GST DRC-03A, is not available on the common portal. Therefore, till the time such functionality is made available on the common portal, in respect of cases where an amount of pre-deposit has been inadvertently paid through FORM GST DRC-03 instead of making the said payment through Electronic Liability Ledger-II against the demand created in the said ledger, the concerned taxpayer may intimate the proper officer about the same, and on such intimation, the proper officer may not insist on recovery for the remaining amount payable by the concerned taxpayer, till the time the said functionality of FORM GST DRC-03A is made available on the portal. 8.2 Once the functionality of FORM GST DRC-03A is made available on the portal, the concerned taxpayer may file an application in FORM GST DRC-03A, on the common portal, at the earliest, as mentioned in para 7.1 above and on doing so, the amount paid vide FORM GST DRC-03 may be adjusted against the pre-deposit under section 107 or section 112 of the CGST Act, as the case may be, as detailed in para 7.2 above. However, in case the taxpayer fails to file an application in FORM GST DRC-03A on the common portal, the proper officer may proceed to recover the amount payable as per provisions of section 78 and section 79 of CGST Act. 9. It is requested that suitable trade notices may be issued to publicize the contents of this Circular. 10.
