In order to enable investors to discern the performance of a CRA vis-\u00e0-vis a standardized PD benchmark scale, CRAs, in consultation with SEBI, shall prepare and disclose standardized and uniform PD benchmarks for each rating category on their website, for one-year, two-year and three-year cumulative default rates, both for short-run and long-run. 25.2. These benchmarks shall be prepared based on the following key principles: 25.2.1. Marginal Default Rate (MDR) approach, using monthly static pool, for last 10-year period. 25.2.2. The short-run benchmarks may account for spikes due to economic cycles or unforeseen events, and hence, may have a wider band. The same shall be computed based on a confidence interval of 99.7% over the weighted average of 1-year, 2-year and 3-year default rates pertaining to last 10- year period, making adjustments to achieve ordinality, wherever required. 25.2.3. The long-run benchmarks iron out economic cycles since these are over a longer tenure (10-year period) and may, therefore, be narrower. The same shall be computed based on a confidence interval of 95% over the weighted average default rates (1-year, 2-year and 3-year) pertaining to 10-year period, making adjustments to achieve ordinality, wherever required. 25.2.4. The same may be adjusted for rating withdrawals. For securities, the rating shall be included in the computation of default rates till the completion of the cohort or the maturity of the instrument, whichever is earlier. 25.2.5. Ratings of non-cooperative issuers shall be included in the cohort under the rating category in which the instrument is currently being rated. 25.2.6. The PD benchmark for the rating categories AAA, AA and A shall be as under, subject to any unexpected legal events/ mitigating circumstances impacting the default rates, with certain permitted tolerance levels: 25.2.6.1. For",
    "AAA: a. Zero for 1-year and 2-year default rate. b. Zero for 3-year default rate, with a tolerance level of 1%. 25.2.6.2. For AA: a. Zero for 1-year default rate. b. Zero for 2-year default rate with a tolerance level of 2%. 25.2.6.3. For A: a. Zero for 1-year default rate with a tolerance level of 3%. 25.2.7. For ratings on non-structured instruments, various instruments of an issuer with equal seniority level and having same rating shall not be included separately for default rate calculation. However, various instruments of an issuer having different seniority levels shall be included as separate instances, subject to a cap of three instances across all rating categories put together. 25.2.8. For ratings on structured instruments, various instruments, issued by a trust, with the same degree of seniority and hence having same rating shall not be included separately for default rate calculation. However, various instruments, issued by a trust, having different seniority levels shall be included as separate instances. Further, in order to avoid under-estimation of default rates in case of significantly higher number of tranches of differing seniority but same rating, a cap of three tranches per rating category per issuer may be applied. 25.2.9. The above PD benchmarks and tolerance levels may be re-indexed from time to time. 25.2.10. The above standardized and uniform PD benchmarks shall be disclosed on the website of each CRA for ratings of long-term and short-term instruments, on a consolidated basis for all financial instruments rated by a CRA. 25.2.11. CRAs may review their rating methodologies in order to align the same with the proposed PD benchmarks. Periodic Disclosures 26.1.

The cumulative default rates(CDR) shall be calculated in the following manner: a. CDR shall be calculated issuer-wise using the Marginal Default Rate (MDR) approach, using monthly static pools. b. The above may be adjusted for rating withdrawals. For securities, the withdrawn rating shall be included in the",
    "computation of default rates till the completion of the cohort or the maturity of the instrument, whichever is earlier. Accordingly, all DTs shall continue to report any delays/ default in payment on debentures to the CRA(s) having rated the said debenture for the lifetime of the instrument, irrespective of the rating on that instrument being withdrawn. c. Ratings of non-cooperative issuers shall be included in the cohort under the rating category in which the instrument is currently being rated. 26.4.1.3. Based on approach mentioned at para 26.4.1.2, CRA shall disclose, on an annual basis, the average one-year, two-year and three-year cumulative default rates (based on weighted average) each for: a.

The format of the above disclosures is specified at Annexure 26. The above disclosures shall be made on a consolidated basis for all financial instruments rated by a CRA. 26.4.1.5. For the above purposes, the following terms shall have the meaning as under: a. Static Pool: Non-defaulted ratings that were outstanding at the beginning of any period. b. Default: Non-payment of interest or principal amount in full on the pre-agreed date. A CRA shall recognize default at the first instance of delay in servicing of interest or principal on the rated debt instrument. c.

A CRA seeking to outsource activities shall have in place a comprehensive policy to guide the assessment of whether and how those activities can be appropriately outsourced. The Board",
    "/ partners (as the case may be) {hereinafter referred to as the \u201cthe Board\u201d} of the CRA shall have the responsibility for the outsourcing policy and related overall responsibility for activities undertaken under that policy. 1.1 The policy shall cover activities or the nature of activities that can be outsourced, the authorities who can approve outsourcing of such activities, and the selection of third party to whom it can be outsourced. For example, an activity shall not be outsourced if it would impair the supervisory authority\u2019s right to assess, or its ability to supervise the business of the CRA. The policy shall be based on an evaluation of risk concentrations, limits on the acceptable overall level of outsourced activities, risks arising from outsourcing multiple activities to the same entity, etc. 1.2 The Board shall mandate a regular review of outsourcing policy for such activities in the wake of changing business environment. It shall also have overall responsibility for ensuring that all ongoing outsourcing decisions taken by the CRA and the activities undertaken by the third-party, are in keeping with its outsourcing policy. 2. The CRA shall establish a comprehensive outsourcing risk management programme to address the outsourced activities and the relationship with the third party. 2.1 The CRA shall make an assessment of outsourcing risk which depends on several factors, including the scope and materiality of the outsourced activity, etc. The factors that could help in considering materiality in a risk management programme include- a) The impact of failure of a third party to adequately perform the activity on the financial, reputational and operational performance of the CRA and on the investors / clients; b) Ability of the CRA to cope up with the work, in case of non- performance or failure by a third party by having suitable back-up arrangements; c) Regulatory status of the third party, including its fitness and probity status; d) Situations involving conflict of interest between the CRA and the third party and the measures put in place by the CRA to address such potential conflicts, etc. 2.2 While there shall not be any prohibition on a group entity / associate of the CRA to act as the third party, systems shall be put in place to have an arm\u2019s length distance between the CRA and the third party in terms of infrastructure, manpower, decision-making, record keeping, etc. for avoidance of potential conflict of interests. Necessary disclosures in this regard shall be made as part of the contractual agreement. It shall be kept in mind that the risk management practices expected to be adopted by the CRA while outsourcing to a related party or an associate would be identical to those followed while outsourcing to an unrelated party. 2.3 The records relating to all activities outsourced shall be preserved centrally so that the same is readily accessible for review by the Board of the CRA and / or its senior management, as and when needed. Such records shall be regularly updated and may also form",
    "part of the corporate governance review by the management of the CRA. 2.4 Regular reviews by internal or external auditors of the outsourcing policies, risk management system and requirements of the regulator shall be mandated by the Board wherever felt necessary. The CRA shall review the financial and operational capabilities of the third party in order to assess its ability to continue to meet its outsourcing obligations. 3. The CRA shall ensure that outsourcing arrangements neither diminish its ability to fulfill its obligations to customers and regulators, nor impede effective supervision by the regulators. 3.1 The CRA shall be fully liable and accountable for the activities that are being outsourced to the same extent as if the service were provided in- house. 3.2 Outsourcing arrangements shall not affect the rights of an investor or client against the CRA in any manner. The CRA shall be liable to the investors for the loss incurred by them due to the failure of the third party and also be responsible for redressal of the grievances received from investors arising out of activities rendered by the third party. 3.3 The facilities / premises / data that are involved in carrying out the outsourced activity by the service provider shall be deemed to be those of the registered CRA. The CRA itself and Regulator or the persons authorized by it shall have the right to access the same at any point of time. 3.4 Outsourcing arrangements shall not impair the ability of SEBI/SRO or auditors to exercise its regulatory responsibilities such as supervision/inspection of the CRA. 4. The CRA shall conduct appropriate due diligence in selecting the third party and in monitoring of its performance. 4.1 It is important that the CRA exercises due care, skill, and diligence in the selection of the third party to ensure that the third party has the ability and capacity to undertake the provision of the service effectively. 4.2 The due diligence undertaken by an CRA shall include assessment of: a) third party\u2019s resources and capabilities, including financial soundness, to perform the outsourcing work within the timelines fixed; b) compatibility of the practices and systems of the third party with the CRA\u2019s requirements and objectives; c) market feedback of the prospective third party\u2019s business reputation and track record of their services rendered in the past; d) level of concentration of the outsourced arrangements with a single third party; and e) the environment of the foreign country where the third party is located. 5. Outsourcing relationships shall be governed by written contracts / agreements / terms and conditions (as deemed appropriate) {hereinafter referred to as \u201ccontract\u201d} that clearly describe all material aspects of the outsourcing arrangement, including the rights, responsibilities and expectations of the parties to the contract, client confidentiality issues, termination procedures, etc. 5.1 Outsourcing arrangements shall be governed by a clearly defined and legally binding written contract between the CRA and each of the third parties, the nature and detail of which shall be appropriate to the materiality",
    "of the outsourced activity in relation to the ongoing business of the CRA. 5.2 Care shall be taken to ensure that the outsourcing contract: a) clearly defines what activities are going to be outsourced, including appropriate service and performance levels; b) provides for mutual rights, obligations and responsibilities of the CRA and the third party, including indemnity by the parties; c) provides for the liability of the third party to the CRA for unsatisfactory performance/other breach of the contract d) provides for the continuous monitoring and assessment by the CRA of the third party so that any necessary corrective measures can be taken up immediately, i.e., the contract shall enable the CRA to retain an appropriate level of control over the outsourcing and the right to intervene with appropriate measures to meet legal and regulatory obligations; e) includes, where necessary, conditions of sub-contracting by the third- party, i.e. the contract shall enable CRA to maintain a similar control over the risks when a third party outsources to further third parties as in the original direct outsourcing; f) has unambiguous confidentiality clauses to ensure protection of proprietary and customer data during the tenure of the contract and also after the expiry of the contract; g) specifies the responsibilities of the third party with respect to the IT security and contingency plans, insurance cover, business continuity and disaster recovery plans, force majeure clause, etc.; h) provides for preservation of the documents and data by third party ; i) provides for the mechanisms to resolve disputes arising from implementation of the outsourcing contract; j) provides for termination of the contract, termination rights, transfer of information and exit strategies; k) addresses additional issues arising from country risks and potential obstacles in exercising oversight and management of the arrangements when CRA outsources its activities to foreign third party. For example, the contract shall include choice-of- law provisions and agreement covenants and jurisdictional covenants that provide for adjudication of disputes between the parties under the laws of a specific jurisdiction; l) neither prevents nor impedes the CRA from meeting its respective regulatory obligations, nor the regulator from exercising its regulatory powers; and m) provides for the CRA and /or the regulator or the persons authorized by it to have the ability to inspect, access all books, records and information relevant to the outsourced activity with the third party. 6. The CRA and its third parties shall establish and maintain contingency plans, including a plan for disaster recovery and periodic testing of backup facilities. 6.1 Specific contingency plans shall be separately developed for each outsourcing arrangement, as is done in individual business lines. 6.2 CRA shall take appropriate steps to assess and address the potential consequence of a business disruption or other problems at the third party level. Notably, it shall consider contingency plans at the third party; co- ordination of contingency plans at both the CRA and the third party; and contingency plans of the CRA in the event of non-performance by the third party. 6.3",
    "To ensure business continuity, robust information technology security is a necessity. A breakdown in the IT capacity may impair the ability of the CRA to fulfill its obligations to other market participants/clients/regulators and could undermine the privacy interests of its customers, harm the CRA\u2019s reputation, and may ultimately impact on its overall operational risk profile. Intermediaries shall, therefore, seek to ensure that third party maintains appropriate IT security and robust disaster recovery capabilities. 6.4 Periodic tests of the critical security procedures and systems and review of the backup facilities shall be undertaken by the CRA to confirm the adequacy of the third party\u2019s systems. 7. The CRA shall take appropriate steps to require that third parties protect confidential information of both the CRA and its customers from intentional or inadvertent disclosure to unauthorized persons. 7.1 CRA that engages in outsourcing is expected to take appropriate steps to protect its proprietary and confidential customer information and ensure that it is not misused or misappropriated. 7.2 The CRA shall prevail upon the third party to ensure that the employees of the third party have limited access to the data handled and only on a \u201cneed to know\u201d basis and the third party shall have adequate checks and balances to ensure the same. 7.3 In cases where the third party is providing similar services to multiple entities, the CRA shall ensure that adequate care is taken by the third party to build safeguards for data security and confidentiality. 8. Potential risks posed where the outsourced activities of multiple intermediaries are concentrated with a limited number of third parties. 8.1. In instances, where the third party acts as an outsourcing agent for multiple intermediaries, it is the duty of the third party and the CRA to ensure that strong safeguards are put in place so that there is no co- mingling of information/documents, records and asset"
