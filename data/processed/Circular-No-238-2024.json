    "the period mentioned in sub-section (1) of section 128A, if any, in the said notice/ statement/ order. Further, the proper officer shall also keep in consideration that waiver of interest and penalty under section 128A is available only in respect of demand pertaining to the period mentioned in sub-section (1) of section 128A, and the demand on issues other than on account of erroneous refund. 3.3.9 Where it is found that any amount of interest and penalty is payable by the applicant on account of some demand pertaining to the period other than the period mentioned in sub-section (1) of section 128A or pertaining to demand of erroneous refund, the detail of the same shall be mentioned in column no. 19 and column no. 20 of FORM GST SPL-05 or FORM GST SPL- 06, as the case may be.

The order issued in FORM GST SPL-07, rejecting the application for waiver, shall be, however, appealable in accordance with sub-section (1) of section 107 within the time limit specified therein, by filing an application in FORM GST APL-01. In such cases, normally, no pre-deposit may be required to be paid by the taxpayer for filing the said appeal, as the said amount may already have been paid as a part of payment of tax dues involved in the demand notice/ statement / order before filing an application in FORM GST SPL-01 or FORM GST SPL-02. However, in cases where no amount of tax dues has been paid or amount of tax dues paid is less than the requisite amount for pre-deposit for filing appeal as per sub-section (6) of section 107, the remaining amount of pre-deposit will be required to be paid for filing the said appeal. 3.4.2 It is also important to note that the subject matter of the appeal will only be regarding the",

(b) in cases, where the taxpayer prefers an appeal against the said rejection order, and the appellate authority holds that the proper officer has wrongly rejected the said application made in FORM GST SPL-02, and issues an order in FORM GST SPL-06, thereby holding that the appellant is eligible for waiver of interest or penalty or both, no appeal shall lie against the said order issued in FORM GST SPL-06. (c) in case, where the taxpayer does not prefer an appeal within the time period mentioned in sub-section (1) of section 107 against the said rejection order, then the original appeal filed by the applicant shall be restored. 4.

Yes, in such cases also the applicant will be required to withdraw the said special leave petition and file an application in FORM GST SPL-01 or FORM GST SPL-02, as the case may be, along with proof of withdrawal of SLP or the copy of the application or any other document filed for withdrawal of SLP, where the order for withdrawal of SLP has not been issued at the time of filing application in FORM GST SPL-01 or FORM GST SPL-02. In such cases, the procedure mentioned in para 3.1.6 may be followed. 10 Whether the benefit provided under Section 128A will be available for matters involving IGST and Compensation Cess? Yes. On joint reading of section 20 of the Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 and section 11 of GST (Compensation to States) Act, 2017 along with section 128A of CGST Act, it becomes clear that the benefit provided under Section 128A of CGST Act will be available for matters involving IGST and compensation cess as well. In this regard, it is mentioned that in such cases, full payment of tax means payment of CGST, SGST, IGST and compensation cess demanded in the notice/ statement/ order, as the case may be. 11 Whether Section 128A covers cases involving demand of irregularly availed transition credit? The transitional credit is considered to be availed on the date on which the said credit amount is credited in the Electronic Credit Ledger. On reading Rule 121 read with sub-rule (3) of rule 117, it is clear that any demand in respect of transitional credit wrongly availed, whether wholly or partly can be made under section 73 or, as the case may be, section 74. Therefore, it is mentioned that if the amount of transitional credit has been availed in the period covered under Section 128A and notice for demand of wrongly availed credit is issued under section 73, the same is covered under Section 128A. 12 Whether Section 128A will cover waiver of penalties under other provisions, late fee, redemption fine etc? It is clarified that any penalty, including penalties under section 73, section 122, section 125 etc, demanded under the demand notice/ statement/ order issued under section 73, is covered under the waiver provided under Section 128A. However, late fee, redemption fine etc are not covered under the waiver provided under Section 128A. 13 Whether payment to avail waiver under Section 128A can be made by utilizing ITC? Yes. The payment of tax required to be made for eligibility for waiver under section 128A is the amount of tax demanded in the notice/ statement/ order. Therefore, it can be paid either by debiting from electronic cash ledger or by utilising the Input Tax Credit (ITC), by debiting the electronic credit ledger,",
    "or partly from both. However, where the demand is in respect of any amount of tax to be paid by the recipient under Reverse Charge Mechanism or by the Electronic Commerce Operator under section 9(5), then the said amount shall be required to be paid by debiting the electronic cash ledger only and not through the electronic credit ledger. Further, where the amount has to be paid for demand of erroneous refund, the demand in respect of erroneous refund paid in cash is required to be paid only by debiting the electronic cash ledger only and not through the electronic credit ledger. 14 Whether the benefit of waiver under Section 128A be availed qua import IGST payable under the Customs Act, 1962? No. In such cases, demand is not issued under section 73 of the CGST Act, but is issued under the provisions of Customs Act, 1962 and therefore, such cases are not covered under waiver of interest or penalty or both under section 128A. 15 With retrospective insertion of sub-sections (5) and (6) to Section 16 of the CGST Act, the tax demanded in notice/ statement/ order reduces. Whether the entire tax amount demanded in the notice/ statement/ order has to be paid in such cases, to avail the benefit under section 128A? Sub-rule (5) of rule 164 mentions that the amount payable in order to avail the benefit under section 128A, shall be calculated after deducting the amount not payable in accordance with sub-section (5) or sub-section (6) of Section 16, from the amount payable in terms of the notice or statement or order under section 73, as the case may be. Therefore, the applicant is required to pay only the amount that is payable, calculated after deducting the amount not payable in accordance with sub-section (5) or sub-section (6) of Section 16, from the amount payable in terms of the notice or statement or order under section 73, as the case may be, before submitting the application. While calculating the amount deductible on account of not being payable in accordance with sub-section (5) or sub-section (6) of Section 16, from the amount payable in terms of the notice or statement or order under section 73, as the case may be, taxpayer is required to ensure that such amount is deducted only where ITC has been denied solely on account of contravention of Section 16(4) of the CGST Act and not on any other grounds. He is also advised to provide a breakup of the amount not payable by him anymore, as per sub-sections (5) and (6) of section 16, in FORM GST SPL-01 or FORM GST SPL-02, as the case may be, to enable the officer to verify the payment easily. It is also re-iterated that where the taxpayer is deducting the amount of ITC which was denied on account of contravention of sub-section (4) of section 16 of the CGST Act, but which is now available, as per retrospectively inserted provisions of sub-section (5) or sub-section",
    "(6) of section 16 of the CGST Act, he is not required to file application for rectification in respect of the same as per special procedure notified under Section 148 vide notification No. 22/2024- Central tax dated 8th October 2024. 16 In case of application in FORM GST SPL-02, where the applicant has paid full or partial amount of tax through FORM GST DRC-03, whether the said applicant is mandatorily required to file application in FORM GST DRC-03A for such tax amount which he desires to get adjusted against tax demand as per FORM GST DRC-07/ FORM GST DRC- 08/ FORM GST APL-04? Yes. In cases where order in FORM GST DRC-07, FORM GST DRC-08 or FORM GST APL-04, as the case may be, has been issued and such taxpayer has paid required amount through FORM GST DRC-03, such applicant is required to adjust the said amount towards the demand created in the Electronic Liability Register, as per the second proviso to sub-rule (2) of rule 164, before filing the application in FORM GST SPL-02. 5.
