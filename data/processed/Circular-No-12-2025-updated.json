In the 2025-26 Budget, BCD on Interactive Flat Panel Displays (IFPDs) classi\ufb01ed under tari\ufb00 item 85285900 was increased from 10% to 20% with e\ufb00ect from 2nd February, 2025 vide Section 103 (a) read with Second Schedule of the Finance Act , 2025 and declaration under the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 2023.

No. 515C of the Noti\ufb01cation No. 50/2017-Customs dated 30.06.2017. This was to prevent circumvention of the higher duty on IFPDs . The intent was not to charge 20% on monitors other than IFPDs. 2. Industry associations have sought clari\ufb01cation regarding compliance with IGCR condition under said entry at S. No. 515C of the Noti\ufb01cation No. 50/2017-Customs since the imported monitors are not used in further manufacturing activity. After examining the issue, vide Noti\ufb01cation No. 23/2025-Customs dated 04.04.2025, the entry at S. No. 515C of the Noti\ufb01cation No. 50/2017-Customs dated 30.06.2017 has been amended to remove the IGCR condition. For distinguishing IFPDs from monitors other than IFPDs, based on the technical inputs from Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) received vide their OM dated 13.03.2025, the following may be used as a technical guide : Feature Monitors (other than IFPDs) Interactive Flat Panel Displays (IFPDs) Touch Capability Non-touch Touch-enabled (multi-touch support) Screen Size Typically, 15\" to 43\" Typically, 55\" to 110\" Resolution HD to 4K 4K or higher Interactivity Limited to keyboard/mouse input Touch, stylus input, and gesture control Built-in Software No built-in software Includes interactive software tools Built-in Speakers External speakers needed Includes high-quality built-in speakers Wattage Typically, 25W-50W Typically, 198W-400W Input Power DC power (Adaptor) AC power 3. References have also been received from \ufb01eld formations and Industry association seeking clari\ufb01cation regarding the appropriate classi\ufb01cation of the IFPDs vis-a vis monitors, other than IFPDs and parts of IFPDs, in light of inconsistency in classi\ufb01cation practice of such goods. To ensure uniformity in tari\ufb00 classi\ufb01cation of the IFPDs and other monitors, it is hereby clari\ufb01ed that both IFPDs and monitors other than IFPDs are classi\ufb01able under tari\ufb00 item 85285900.
