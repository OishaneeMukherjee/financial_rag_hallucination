This is in-line with announcement by Hon\u2019ble Finance Minister to digitize all the remaining Customs processes by mid-2026. For example, system-based automated clearances for certain imports of authorized importers were introduced in Customs to reduce the time-taken in this regard. Similarly, all the payments made to the Customs have made digital through electronic payment gateway of ICEGATE. 1.2 On the similar lines, one of the important aspects identified by CBIC for automation is relating to refund procedure under Customs. 2.1 Customs Act, 1962 provides for processing the claim for refund by any person of any Customs duty and interest paid or borne by him under section 27. Further, Refund is also sanctioned for export duty in certain cases under Section 26 or under certain notifications such as 102/2007- Customs. 2.2 Currently, Refund Application under section 27 is filed manually in terms of Customs Refunds Application (Form) Regulations, 1995.
