References have been received from field formations regarding non-compliance of provisions of mandatory recording of correct place of supply on the invoices by the suppliers in respect of online services provided by them, either themselves or through electronic commerce operators, to unregistered recipients due to wrong interpretation of provisions of section 12(2)(b) of Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 (hereinafter referred to as \u201cIGST Act\u201d) read with rule 46 of Central Goods and Services Rules, 2017 (hereinafter referred to as \u201cCGST Rules\u201d). It has also been mentioned that though in such cases of taxable online supplies of services to unregistered recipients, registered suppliers are required to mention State name of the recipient on the invoice, irrespective of the value of such supply, and declare place of supply of such services as the State of the recipient as per the provisions of clause (i) of section 12(2)(b) of IGST Act but many suppliers are not recording the State name of the unregistered recipient on the invoice and are declaring place of supply of such services as the location of the supplier as per clause (ii) of section 12(2)(b) of IGST Act. This is resulting in wrong declaration of place of supply, resulting in flow of revenue in respect of the said supply to the wrong State. Request has been made to clarify the issue so as to ensure correct declaration of place of supply by the suppliers of such services to unregistered recipients. 2. In order to clarify the issue and to ensure uniformity in the implementation of the provisions of the law across field formations, the Board, in exercise of its powers conferred by section 168(1) of the Central Goods and Services Act, 2017 (hereinafter referred to as \u201cCGST Act\u201d) hereby issues the following clarification. 3.

    "that a registered person providing taxable services must issue a tax invoice with details like the service description, value, tax charged and such other particulars as may be prescribed. 4.3 Rule 46 of CGST Rules provides the particulars required to be mentioned on the tax invoice.

Accordingly, in such cases, the place of supply of such services shall be considered as the location of the recipient of the services as per provisions of clause (i) of section 12(2)(b) of IGST Act. 4.5 It is also observed that a combined reading of the definitions of \u2018electronic commerce\u2019 and \u2018electronic commerce operator\u2019 as per section 2(44) and section 2(45) of CGST Act, along with rule 46(f) of CGST Rules, leads to an understanding that all services supplied to unregistered recipients over digital or electronic network, either by the supplier using his own digital or electronic facility / platform or through any other electronic or digital platform owned and operated by an independent electronic commerce operator, will be covered under proviso to rule 46(f) of CGST Rules. 4.5.1 It is, accordingly, clarified that provisions of proviso to rule 46(f) of CGST Rules shall be applicable in respect of all the online supplies of services supplied to an unregistered recipient, in addition to the supply of online money gaming and OIDAR",
    "services.
