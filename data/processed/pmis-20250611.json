About the scheme The Prime Minister Internship Scheme (PMIS) is part of the Prime Minister\u2019s package of five schemes and initiatives to facilitate employment, skilling and other opportunities for Indian youth over a 5-year period. PMIS is aimed towards youth aged 21-24 who are currently not enrolled in any full-time academic program or employment, offering them paid internship opportunities in top companies across India. This scheme plans to offer over one crore internships over the next five years and is aimed at enhancing employability of Indian youth. The pilot phase of the scheme that aims to provide 1.25 lakh internships is currently underway. a. Top companies of India are directly involved in training and skilling candidates. This will ensure that the training is comprehensive and relevant to current needs and future demands. b. Youth can get exposure and experience to professional environments at a very early stage of their career and learn soft skills, build networks and make an impression. c. By bridging the gap between education and employment readiness, PMIS is set to catalyse the transformation of India\u2019s workforce into a skilled and efficient engine, driving the nation\u2019s socio-economic growth forward. d. Each intern will be supported with monthly financial assistance of \u20b95,000, supplemented by one-time financial assistance of \u20b96,000. e. The scheme covers a broad spectrum of sectors, providing tailored internships that align with the interns' educational qualifications and career ambitions.

Companies create their profile, upload internship opportunities, mark statuses of candidates etc., on the portal. From the perspective of candidates, the portal is used for registration, profile creation, application as well as tracking all updates (including payments) throughout the internship life cycle. g. Eligible candidates can explore and select internships based on their preferred location and sector. Each applicant can apply to up to 5 internships. h. Each internship is a combination of relevant training and professional on the field experience (at least 6 months) to ensure that candidates learn and can also apply their skills in real-world settings. i. The pilot phase has revealed need for certain initiatives to enhance the interns\u2019 learning experience beyond that of a workplace to include a comprehensive support system that addresses the various facets of an intern's journey. The Ministry is thus committed to enhancing the PMIS by creating a supportive ecosystem that not only enriches the interns' professional skills but also provides them with the necessary tools and resources to navigate their internships effectively. j. In response to these needs, the Ministry seeks to develop collaborative platforms and systems that will facilitate knowledge sharing, mentorship, and community engagement among interns and industry professionals. This initiative is poised to transform the internship landscape in India, ensuring that PMIS participants gain not only work experience but also a holistic personality developmental experience. 2.
