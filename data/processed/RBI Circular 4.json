DOR.AML.REC.31/14.01.001/2025-26, dated June 12, 2025 on Updation/ Periodic Updation of KYC\u2013 Revised Instructions) The Master Direction - Know Your Customer (KYC) Direction, 2016 dated February 25, 2016 (as amended from time to time) instructs the Regulated Entities (REs), including banks, that the customers\u2019 KYC Identifier shall be the first reference point for the purpose of establishing an account-based relationship or for verification of identity of customers. Accordingly, while onboarding customer, the REs shall download customers\u2019 KYC records online from CKYCR with customer\u2019s consent without requiring him/ her to submit the same records again, unless there is a change in records available with CKYCR. The processes of onboarding customer and updation/ periodic updation of KYC have been simplified and the same are given below: A. Face-to-face mode for onboarding the customer (i) Customer may be onboarded in face-to-face mode through Aadhaar biometric based e-KYC authenticating and, in such case, if customer wants to provide a current address, different from the address as per the identity information available in the UIDAI database (i.e., Central Identities Data Repository), he may give a self-declaration to that effect to the RE (ref. paragraph 16 of the Master Direction on KYC). (ii)",
    "Further, Digital KYC process is also allowed for customer onboarding. B. Non-face-to-face (NFTF) modes for onboarding the customer (i) Consent-based onboarding of customer in NFTF mode may be done using Aadhaar OTP based e-KYC authentication which is subject to certain conditions (ref. paragraph 17 of the Master Direction on KYC). Further, such account shall be placed under strict monitoring, and Customer Due Diligence (CDD) procedure shall be completed within a year. (ii) Customer onboarding in NFTF mode using digital modes such as KYC Identifier, equivalent e-documents, documents issued through DigiLocker, and non-digital modes such as obtaining copy of OVD certified by additional certifying authorities as allowed for NRIs and PIOs are subject to certain conditions (ref. paragraph 40 of the Master Direction on KYC). C. Customer onboarding using Video based Customer Identification Process (V-CIP) (i) V-CIP is an alternate method of CDD by an authorised official of the RE by undertaking seamless, secure, live, informed and consent based audiovisual interaction with the customer to obtain identification information required for CDD purpose (ref. paragraph 18 of the Master Direction on KYC). (ii) V-CIP is treated on par with face-to-face onboarding. D. Simplified process of updation and periodic updation of KYC (i) Self-declarations - REs are allowed to obtain self-declaration regarding \u201cno change in KYC information\u201d or \u201ca change only in address details\u201d from customers using digital and non-digital modes, through customer\u2019s email / mobile number registered with the RE, ATMs, digital channels (such as online banking / internet banking, mobile application of RE), letter, BCs, etc. (ii) The updation/ periodic updation of KYC records are allowed to be carried out at any branch of the RE with which customer maintains the account. (iii) Aadhaar OTP based e-KYC and V-CIP are permitted for the purpose of updation/ periodic updation of KYC.
