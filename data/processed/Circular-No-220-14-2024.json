In order to clarify the issue and to ensure uniformity in the implementation of the provisions of law across the field formations, the Board, in exercise of its powers conferred by section 168(1) of the Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 (hereinafter referred to as \u201cCGST Act\u201d), hereby clarifies the issue as under: Issue Clarification Whether the activity of providing Custodial Services by banks or financial institutions to FPIs will be treated as services provided to 'account holder' under Section 13(8)(a) of the IGST Act, 2017? Further, how the place of supply of the said services shall be determined? According to the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Custodian of Securities) Regulations 1996, \u2018Custodial Services\u2019 in relation to securities means safekeeping of securities of a client and providing services incidental thereto, and includes- \u2022 maintaining accounts of securities of a client; \u2022 collecting the benefits or rights accruing to the client in respect of securities; \u2022 keeping the client informed of the actions taken or to be taken by the issuer of securities, having a bearing on the benefits or rights accruing to the client; and \u2022 maintaining and reconciling records of the services referred above.

    "Reserve Bank of India for foreign portfolio investors to invest in from time to time; and (h) such other instruments as specified by the Board from time to time. Various banks enter into custodial agreements with the Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) for the provision of such custodial services. The main activity carried out by banks as a custodian in relation to custodial services is maintaining account of the securities held by the FPIs. As per clause (a) of sub-section (8) of section 13 of IGST Act, Place of Supply of services supplied by banking company or a financial institution or a non-banking company to account holders shall be the location of the supplier of services. As per Explanation (a) of Section 13(8) of IGST Act, \u2018account\u2019 means an account bearing interest to the depositor, and includes a non-resident external account and a non-resident ordinary account. It is mentioned that the provisions similar to above provisions under IGST Act existed during the Service Tax regime. The place of provision of service under Service Tax was governed by the Service Tax Place of Provision of Supply Rules, 2012. Provisions of Rule 9(a) of the Service Tax Place of Provision of Supply Rules, 2012 were identical to that of section 13(8)(a) of the IGST Act. The Education Guide under the Service Tax Law clarified the scope of the term \u201caccount holder\u201d and the services provided by banks to account holders as well as the services which are not provided to account holders, as below: \u201cQuestion: 5.9.2 What is the meaning of \"account holder\"? Which accounts are not covered by this rule? Answer: \"Account\" has been defined in the rules to mean an account which bears an interest to the depositor. Services provided to holders of demand deposits, term deposits, NRE (non-resident external) accounts and NRO (non-resident ordinary) accounts will be covered under this rule. Question:5.9.3 What are the services that are provided by a banking company to an account holder (holder of an account bearing interest to the depositor)? Answer: Following are examples of services that are provided by a banking company or financial institution to an \u201caccount holder\u201d, in the ordinary course of business :- i) services linked to or requiring opening and operation of bank accounts such as lending, deposits, safe deposit locker etc; ii) transfer of money including telegraphic transfer, mail transfer, electronic transfer etc. Question:5.9.4 What are the services that are not provided by a banking company or financial institution to an account holder, in the ordinary course of business, and will consequently be covered under another Rule? Answer: Following are examples of services that are generally NOT provided by a banking company or financial institution to an account holder (holder of a deposit account bearing interest), in the ordinary course of business:- i) financial leasing services including equipment leasing and hire purchase; ii) merchant banking services; iii) Securities and foreign exchange (forex) broking, and purchase or sale of foreign currency, including money changing; iv) asset management including portfolio",
    "management, all forms of fund management, pension fund management, custodial, depository and trust services In the case of any service which does not qualify as a service provided to an account holder, the place of provision will be determined under the default rule i.e. the Main Rule 3. Thus, it will be the location of the service receiver where it is known (ascertainable in the ordinary course of business), and the location of the service provider otherwise.\u201d Accordingly, as per clarification given in Education Guide under Service Tax Regime, the custodial services are not considered to be covered under the services provided by bank to account holders, but have been considered to be covered under the services which are not provided to account holder. As the provisions of section 13(8)(a) of the IGST Act are similar to the provisions of Rule 9(a) of the Service Tax Place of Provision of Supply Rules, 2012, the clarification given in the Education Guide under Service Tax Regime is equally applicable under GST Regime. Accordingly, it is clarified that the custodial services provided by banks or financial institutions to FPIs are not to be treated as services provided to 'account holder' and therefore, the said services are not covered under Section 13(8)(a) of the IGST Act. Therefore, the place of supply of such services is not to be determined under Section 13(8)(a) of the IGST Act but has to be determined under the default provision i.e., sub-section (2) of section 13 of the IGST Act. 2. It is requested that suitable trade notices may be issued to publicize the contents of this Circular. 3. Difficulty, if any, in implementation of the above instructions may please be brought to the notice of the Board. Hindi version would follow. (Sanjay Mangal) Principal Commissioner (GST)"
